NextBest is a recommendation system with two variants: MovieMate for recommending movies and AnimeMate for recommending anime. This project is perfect for enthusiasts who want to discover new content through personalized recommendations.

Whether you're a cinephile or an anime lover, NextBest aims to provide you with tailored suggestions based on your preferences.

## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m Shankar Singh, a second-year B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). Developing NextBest has allowed me to delve into my interests in data science, machine learning, and web development. Through this project, Iâ€™ve explored content-based recommendation systems for both movies and anime, providing a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.

I'm passionate about expanding my knowledge of technology and enjoy working on projects that integrate data structures, algorithms, and machine learning. Feel free to explore the repository, and reach out if youâ€™re interested in collaborating or discussing ideas!

Let me know if youâ€™d like to add anything else!

## Important Note

Models Not Included: To reduce repository size, model files (.pkl) are not included. To run this project, you'll need to execute the provided Jupyter notebooks to generate the models yourself.

## Installation

**Installation Guide**

1. **Prerequisites**
Before installing the app, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

    â€¢	Python (Version 3.7 or higher)

    â€¢	pip (Python package manager)


2. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashbisht077/NextBest.git
cd NextBest
```
3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with system-wide packages.

â€¢	Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
â€¢	Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. **Install Dependencies**

Use pip to install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. If the requirements.txt file is not yet created, you can manually list dependencies, such as:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. **Set Up API Key for Movie Database**

To fetch movie details (posters, ratings, etc.), you need to register for an API key from The Movie Database (TMDb).

    1.	Visit TMDb API and create an account if you donâ€™t have one.
    2.	Obtain your API Key from the TMDb settings.
    3.	Store the API key in your code by replacing the placeholder values in the api_keys list in the app.py file.
```bash
api_keys = [
    "your_tmdb_api_key_here"
]
```
6. **Generate Models**

Since model files (.pkl) are not provided, run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory to create the necessary models for movie and anime recommendations.

7. **Run the Streamlit App**

Once the dependencies are installed and the API key is configured, you can start the app using Streamlit. Run the following command from your project directory:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
8. **Access the App**

After running the command, Streamlit will start the app and provide a local URL like http://localhost:8501/ where you can access the app.

Troubleshooting

â€¢	Issue: Missing Dependencies :
If you run into issues with missing packages, ensure youâ€™ve activated your virtual environment (if youâ€™re using one) and installed all necessary dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.

â€¢	Issue: API Key Invalid :
If you receive errors related to fetching movie details, verify that your TMDb API key is correct and placed properly in the code.

This guide should help you get your Movie-Mate app up and running. Let me know if you encounter any issues during installation!
